I don’t know why, but I felt dizzy and had sore eyes today — probably because I’ve been spending too much time in front of screens lately. I should cut down on my screen time over the next few days and see if I feel better.

This reminded me of my working days in Shanghai. Honestly, I don’t think I’m suited for any job that requires long hours on the computer.

Like the past few days, I woke up very early again this morning — around 6:30 a.m. To be honest, I didn’t feel great after getting up.

For breakfast, I made stir-fried rice noodles with egg and bean sprouts (鸡蛋豆芽炒粉). It tasted really good and was easy to digest — which is crucial for me, since I have gastritis.

After breakfast, I went to the hospital for an umbilical moxibustion treatment (脐灸), which is supposed to help with digestion. During the treatment, I just lay down and rested without looking at my phone — it felt good to recharge my energy that way.

For lunch, I made only one dish, like yesterday — stir-fried chicken with green peppers (青椒炒鸡). It didn’t taste bad, but the chicken was a bit watery before cooking.

After lunch, I took a nap on the couch, then continued watching IELTS prep videos until around 5:30 p.m.

Originally, I planned to play basketball in the evening, but I wasn’t feeling well, as I mentioned earlier. So I decided to go for a walk instead.

At this stage of my life, I think the most important thing is staying healthy. It’s the foundation of everything — without health, we can’t achieve anything.

Once again, I really need to stay away from electronic devices for a few days. And I need to think seriously about what kind of work I can do in the future — otherwise, life could easily turn into a nightmare.
