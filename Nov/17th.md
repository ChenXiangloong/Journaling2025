# Mon, Nov 17, 2025 · Windy 🌧 · 5–17°C 

Today is a special day — it’s my birthday, and it’s also exactly six months since I came back from Shanghai.

It was a bit annoying that I still woke up very early — around 5 a.m. According to the data from the Apple Health app, I only slept 6 hours and 29 minutes last night.

For breakfast, I had pork rice noodles and a cup of milk. To be honest, I’ve kind of fallen in love with wide rice noodles (宽粉) over round rice noodles (圆粉) lately.

After breakfast, I went to my grandma’s home and had lunch with her, because she invited me last week to celebrate my birthday together. It always feels cozy to eat at her place, even though today was super windy and cold (especially compared to yesterday’s warm and sunny weather).

After coming back, I felt fatigued and sleepy, so I took a nap. I originally hoped I could sleep longer and deeper, like I used to on weekends before I got gastritis, but I woke up just 20 minutes later. What made it more frustrating was that I still felt tired and dizzy after waking up.

So I did some research on ChatGPT, and the conclusion was that these symptoms might be due to low blood pressure and anemia. GPT also suggested that being sedentary should be avoided.

Since it was too cold and windy outside, I went to Hema supermarket instead and listened to a podcast while walking around.

Six months ago, even before I quit my job, I planned to give myself one year to recover. So far, I think I’m about 70% recovered. So let’s be patient and see what happens in the next six months. We need to trust the process.
