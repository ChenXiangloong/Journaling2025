I had an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach throughout the day. I’ve been thinking about seeing a doctor again. I went to see a Chinese medicine doctor twice recently — it helped me recover, especially with my constipation — but I really treasure the constant sunny weather.

It was really annoying that the power in our building went out this morning, and the water supply was also cut off. I had to wait until the water was restored to wash my hair. By the time I was ready to go outside, it was already 10:30 a.m. Consequently, I gave up on going to Xihu Park and went for a walk along the nearby riverside instead.

While walking, I read an English book intensively. I felt like my mind was absorbing English like a sponge absorbs water. Honestly, I haven’t felt this way in a long time, and I loved it.

Even though I woke up early this morning — around 6:00 a.m. — I napped well in the afternoon. When I walked out the door later, my mind felt much clearer and lighter.

Once again, for me, a good day means: sleeping well, eating healthy, being free of illness, and enjoying good weather.

Oh, there’s one thing I almost forgot — my friend (we were classmates back in high school) contacted me on WeChat. He asked if I was interested in starting a cross-border e-commerce business together. He is planning to quit his current job in the architecture industry soon.

Frankly, I’m not sure what the right decision is for me, but I think I can give it a try to see whether it’s enjoyable and profitable, instead of saying no right away — as long as I prepare well beforehand. So I told him we can discuss it when we meet in person next time. I should remain truly open-minded. After all, I don’t have to work for money now. I work for enjoyment — to pursue happiness and real wealth, rather than money, status, titles, or material possessions.
