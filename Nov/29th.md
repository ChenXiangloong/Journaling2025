Today, I visited another new park — Yanghu Wetland Park. It must be the biggest park among all the ones I’ve been to recently. It has several huge grass fields, and many people were having picnics there. There’s even a museum inside the park. The only drawback is that it’s quite far from my apartment — about an hour by metro — and it’s a long walk from the nearest station.

I don’t know why, but thoughts about how to deal with my mother kept coming back to me from time to time. It’s always stressful and headache-inducing to talk to her. I get irritated and lose my temper so easily whenever we have a conversation. With the 2026 New Year’s Eve approaching, I’m already starting to feel tense — even though there are still two months to go.

From my past experiences, I’ve learned an important lesson: always set boundaries in every relationship — whether romantic, friendly, or familial. People are complicated, and relationships are complicated.
