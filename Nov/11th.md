I still felt tired today - even worse than yesterday.

I woke up very early again this morning — around 5 a.m. I got up to pee and then went back to sleep until 6:45. I lay in bed for a while before getting up, which made my breakfast later than usual.

For breakfast, I made tofu and minced meat rice noodles (豆腐碎肉粉).

After breakfast, I went to KFC as usual to work on my IELTS prep. I did two listening practice tests today. They felt more difficult than I expected, so I need to practice more and expand my vocabulary to improve my listening.

I felt sleepy the whole morning, so as soon as I got home, I took a nap for about an hour and a half — even before eating lunch.

I felt better after waking up; my mind became clearer. For lunch, I made stir-fried eggs with tomatoes as my only dish and had it with rice. It tasted so good — perfect to go with rice (很下饭).

After lunch, I continued studying IELTS materials until 6 p.m. Then I went downstairs to play basketball for an hour. I sweated a lot, but my body felt warm and energized. I took a shower after coming back home. It’s always so comfortable to take a warm shower after exercising and sweating.

How to live a happy life?
Maybe it’s simple: eat healthy, stay fit, sleep well, and keep a peaceful mind.
