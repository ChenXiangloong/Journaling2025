It’s freezing cold today, but the sunshine is great.

Technically speaking, I slept relatively well — a total of 8 hours and 57 minutes. Even though I woke up once in the early morning, I fell back asleep afterwards. What frustrated me was that I still felt fatigued and sleepy.

For breakfast, I had rice noodles with fried fish and a poached egg (荷包蛋), plus a cup of milk as usual.

Since I had planned to make braised beef with potatoes (土豆炖牛肉) — a dish that takes longer to cook — I started preparing lunch very early, right after breakfast. It smelled amazing, and it tasted great. The sauce was perfect with rice (汤汁很下饭).

As usual, I took a nap on the couch after lunch.

Around 3:30 p.m., I went to a nearby RT-MART (大润发) and listened to podcasts while walking around. I still felt fatigued, but it was much better than staying at home scrolling on my phone. And I felt noticeably better — my mind became lighter and clearer — as it got closer to twilight.

I tried my best to avoid being sedentary today, and it actually helped. Let’s be patient and see what things look like three months from now. It’s extremely frustrating when I don’t have the energy to do anything, not even read.
