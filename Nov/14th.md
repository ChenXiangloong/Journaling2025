Overall, I felt happy and fulfilled today, even though I still didn’t sleep well and woke up very early — around 5 a.m.

For breakfast, I kept things simple: half of the naan I bought last night, steamed egg custard, a cup of milk, and two kiwifruits.

Then I headed to South Suburban Park. The weather was just as perfect as yesterday — warm, sunny, and ideal for being outdoors. The park is a mountainous urban park near the Xiang River, and you can see the river clearly from the top. The mountain isn’t high, so it’s an easy walk to the peak. I was surprised to find a basketball court inside the park.

I really loved the vibe this morning — walking on the mountain in such warm sunshine felt perfect. It reminded me of my trips to Hong Kong during the Spring Festival and to Korea in May.

For lunch, I cooked stir-fried pork with carrots. It tasted delicious, smelled amazing, and the meat was tender.

While eating lunch (and a bit afterward), I watched some Douyin videos, and then I took a nap until 4 p.m.

Originally, I planned to get a haircut after waking up, but the hairdresser was fully booked. So instead, I watched IELTS prep videos until nearly 5 p.m.

I couldn’t decide whether to take a walk or play basketball. My brain said “go for a walk,” but my body was already changing clothes — so I ended up choosing basketball. And it turned out to be the right choice.

I first played one-on-one with a guy, and after he left, I played a two-on-two game with three other guys. My shooting felt amazing today — almost like my hands were on fire. It felt like everything came back, just like how I played in Shanghai half a year ago. I even made a new friend — the guy I played 1-on-1 with added me on WeChat and said we could play 3x3 or 4x4 next time.

Finally, one thing really worth noting: my body felt so comfortable and relaxed on the court — the exact opposite of what I feel when I stare at screens. I really need to think seriously about my future career — ideally something related to the outdoors.
