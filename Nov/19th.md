# Wed, Nov 19, 2025 · Sunny 🔆 · 6–13°C

For breakfast, I had rice noodles with a fried egg, fried pork, and some Chinese baby cabbage (娃娃菜), plus a cup of milk.

Today was a sunny day — and I love sunny days — so I went to South Suburb Park (南郊公园) again in the morning. It didn’t feel as refreshing as the first time I went, but it’s still a nice place to visit when the weather is good.

For lunch, I made fried fish with green pepper and garlic.

I didn’t sleep well during my nap on the couch, so I went to bed to continue napping. But it was really annoying that I couldn’t fall asleep again, so I had no choice but to get up.

Around 5 o’clock, I walked to the nearby Hema supermarket, but they didn’t have the kind of chicken I wanted today, so I walked back home. When I passed a food stall inside Hema, I really wanted to buy grilled squid (烤鱿鱼), but I held back because of the price — around 17 RMB. Instead, I bought a naan on my way back. It was my second time buying naan from that same restaurant, and I finished the whole thing without feeling any discomfort in my stomach this time.

I still felt a bit dizzy and fatigued today, so I chose to listen to podcasts most of the time instead of reading or watching videos. It’s a daily struggle. I feel like my head is being pushed underwater — unable to do anything except wait for the day when I can finally lift my head above the surface and take a breath.
