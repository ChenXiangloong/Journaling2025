I had a great day today as well, and I’m really thankful for the perfect weather we’ve had these days.

I had a simple breakfast—tomato and egg noodles. Then I went to a park I had never been to before: Yanghu Wetland Park. It’s huge, with several lakes inside. Because of limited time, I only visited one of them—the earliest-developed one. The lake looks quite new, and the surrounding streets and buildings are new as well. Everything felt refreshing. I realized I had been biased against western Changsha (Yuelu District). In fact, it looks new, modern, and clean—much nicer compared to the older, more traditional eastern part of the city.

I was even thinking, while biking around, that I should visit this area more often in the future.

At noon, I bought a 1-kilogram grass carp. The fishmonger helped me kill it and cut it into pieces. The fish was too big for me to finish at once, so I divided it into three portions. I used two portions to make Hunan-style boiled fish—one for lunch and the other reserved for tomorrow’s breakfast. The last portion I turned into fried fish, which I can keep for next week.

After I woke up from my nap, I noticed I had missed a phone call. I guessed it might be from my hairdresser, since I planned to get a haircut this afternoon, but I wasn’t sure—it could have been spam. Surprisingly, the same number called again just when I was about to go out. So I answered it. Turns out I made a mistake: I thought my appointment was at 4:30 p.m., but it was actually at 4:00 p.m.

I really should start adding appointments to my Calendar or Reminders.

After that, I rescheduled my haircut for tomorrow and watched IELTS videos until 5 p.m.

Then I went to play basketball like yesterday. But today, for some reason, I felt weak while playing. At some moments, I even felt a bit sad about my health condition. I really hope I can become as healthy and strong as I was 11 or 12 years ago.

Still, if I look at things positively, my digestion has improved a lot compared to six months ago. That’s already a big step forward, and maybe I just need more time to fully recover.
