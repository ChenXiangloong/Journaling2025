I still woke up very early this morning — maybe around 5 a.m. I got up to pee and then went back to sleep until 7. Overall, I haven’t been sleeping well this past week — I keep waking up around 5 or 6 a.m. I’m not sure why.

For breakfast, I made a fried egg, scalded some broccoli, and had oats with milk.

After breakfast, I went to KFC as usual to work on my IELTS prep.

For lunch, I made homestyle tofu and stir-fried mung bean sprouts with eggs. I loved how the tofu turned out — probably the best tofu dish I’ve ever made. I think meat, green onion, and green pepper are the key ingredients.

As usual, I took a nap after lunch. Then I continued studying IELTS materials after I woke up.

Around 6:30 p.m., I took out the trash and went for a walk.

Overall, I felt a bit tired today because of the poor sleep.

One more thing worth mentioning — I bought a new membership card and booked a class on the Popcorn Club website. It’s been half a year since my last class there, back in May. It felt nice to interact with Xiaopa (Popcorn Club’s official WeChat account) again.
