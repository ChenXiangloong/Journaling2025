I still felt a bit dizzy and low on energy today, even though my sleep score on the Apple Health app was high — 96, with 8 hours and 10 minutes of sleep. But I felt much better than yesterday, probably because I spent most of the day outdoors.

I had a quick breakfast — a fried egg, blanched broccoli, and milk oatmeal.

Then I went to the famous and beautiful Orange Island (橘子洲) with my grandma. The weather was perfect — sunny and warm, just right for outdoor activities. I took a few casual photos, and they all turned out so clean and beautiful.

For lunch, I made stir-fried eggplant with green peppers (青椒炒茄子) and a salted duck egg (咸鸭蛋). It was a simple and quick meal.

As usual, I took a nap after lunch. Instead of staying home and spending time on screens afterward, I rode to the Hema(盒马) supermarket and then walked back home.

On the way there and back, I listened to a few podcast episodes on Spotify.

To be honest, I’ve never used this app so deeply before. I just realized how awesome Spotify is — it feels like a treasure box to me. First, it has tons of high-quality English podcasts that Apple Podcasts and Chinese platforms don’t have. Second, its user experience is even better than Apple Podcasts, even though they share many of the same shows. (But I still think Xiaoyuzhou小宇宙 has the best UX among all these apps.)

In the next few days, I plan to spend more time listening to podcasts on Spotify and less time looking at screens. That way, I can keep up my study habit while saving my energy at the same time.
