I visited a new park this morning. The weather was perfect—warm, sunny, and relaxing. While strolling, I did my IELTS speaking mock test and finished my November monthly review.

Recently, I haven’t been using my laptop much. At the beginning of last month, long hours in front of the screen made me feel dizzy and gave me headaches. So this time I wrote my review in a simpler way—just on my phone. It turns out writing doesn’t always have to be done on a laptop. With a phone or iPad, I can study or work anywhere, anytime. Maybe this can be my compromise going forward: study outdoors on mobile devices rather than sitting indoors using a laptop.

Since my WeChat official account is followed by friends, I worried my monthly review—especially the part about IELTS prep—might accidentally spark envy or misunderstanding. People can be sensitive sometimes. So I had the idea of posting a few unrelated updates together to keep things low-key. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’d rather protect our friendships. Staying low-key seems like a safer approach.
