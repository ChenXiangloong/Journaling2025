Recently, I’ve been reading almost every tweet Pieter Levels posts about traveling in China. It has already become my nightly routine. I commented on one of his posts tonight, and he replied to me. I could sense from his words that he resonated with what I said — it felt genuine.

To be honest, I’m a bit obsessed with these China-travel threads. I can scroll through them for hours without even noticing. But I don’t think it’s a waste of time. It’s actually an enjoyable and effective way to practice English — completely effortless.

As my health condition has been improving lately, I’ve started feeling an urge to find a girlfriend. What can I do?

1. Go out and meet people.
2. Make it clear that I’m single and open to dating.
3. Vitality matters — keep my energy up.
4. And when there’s a chance, just tell myself, “Why not?”

The most annoying thing right now is my low energy. I feel like something is holding me back from running or flying. All I can do is walk slowly, like an old man.
