Another sunny day.

I went to Houhu Park again this morning, but it was windy, which made it feel much colder than before.

For lunch, I made stir-fried beef with celery. The beef wasn’t tough this time since I’ve learned from my previous attempts, but the taste turned out a bit watery and light. There’s still room for improvement.

Around 5 p.m., I played basketball for a while just to activate my body. But my energy still felt low—pretty much the same old feeling I’ve had most of the time.

Time flies. The year 2025 is coming to an end. Will 2026 be a better year for me? And for us?
Let’s wait and see.
